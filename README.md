# Motimates

Motimates is derived from the words "motivation" and "mates." It's intended to help the everyday person match up with people who have similar goals, so that they can hold each other accountable and motivate each other. By using Motimates, I hope to encourage people to help each other take the small daily steps that are necessary in learning a new language, developing new cleaning habits, or exercising regularly.
